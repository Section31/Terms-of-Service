## DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
[Section31 OÜ](https://www.sect31.com) is an online website and services platform that provides ledger entry translation to and from various blockchain technologies.

At this time, we do not support FIAT conversions or interact with FIAT in any way, nor do we store the input assets or manage user assets on their behalf. We offer only ledger entry translation and therefore require that the user be the beneficial owner of the sending address of the input assets, the destination address, and the refund address for each transaction. Other terms and conditions apply as described in further sections of this Terms of Service.

## ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TERMS OF SERVICE
Please read these Terms of Service carefully before accessing or using our website or services. By accessing or using any part of the website or services that we provide, or consenting via an "opt-in" mechanism, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to all the Terms and Conditions of this agreement, then you may not access and are completely prohibited from using the website and all services provided by us. If these Terms of Service are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms of Service.

## LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS COMPLIANCE
You agree to be bound by all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. You also agree that you are responsible for compliance with, and that you are compliant with, all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. If you are non-compliant with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, you are prohibited from using or accessing the website and services that we provide; your only recourse being to stop using the website and services provided by us. 

## MODIFICATION OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE
We may at any time and without notice to you or third parties modify these Terms of Service. By using the website or any services that we provide, or by consenting via an "opt-in" mechanism, you agree to be bound by the then-current version of our Terms of Service. 

Furthermore, we reserve the right to make any changes retroactively - which may affect ledger entry translations, transactions, or other activities that you have already undertaken. It is recommended to check back often to review any possible changes to these Terms of Service.

## USE RESTRICTIONS
We reserve the right to terminate your access to our website and services for any reason and in our sole and absolute discretion. Use of our website and services is void where prohibited by applicable law.
Furthermore, by accessing or using any part of the website or services we provide, or by consenting via an "opt-in" mechanism, you represent and warrant the following:
*	You are at least 18 years of age and have full capacity to contract under applicable law.
*	You are only transacting with legally-obtained assets that belong to you.
*	You are not furthering, performing, undertaking, engaging in, aiding, or abetting any unlawful activity through your relationship with us or through your use of our services or website.
*	You are complying with and obeying all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
*	You are not transacting in or from a high-risk jurisdiction as defined by E.U. financial or U.S. economic sanctions programs including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") and the restrictive measures of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy ("CFSP").
*	You are not accessing our website or services to transmit, translate, or otherwise transact with digital assets that are the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity, including terrorism or tax evasion.
*	You are not using or accessing our website or services in an abusive manner including, but not limited to, submission of translations or other data which imposes an unreasonable or unmanageably large load on our platform, whether or not it interferes with normal operations.
*	You are using or accessing our website or services as a mechanism of software ledger entry translation between the user and us, meaning that all transactions processed by us are two-party transactions. 
*	You are not using or accessing our website or services for the purpose of translating ledger entries with any other parties. 
*	You are the beneficial owner of the sending address of the input assets, the destination address, and the refund address for each transaction.

## FORFEITURE OF FUNDS, LOSS OF FUNDS, AND TRANSACTION DENIAL
You recognize and accept that any funds found to be in violation of these Terms of Service may be seized and donated to a charity at our sole discretion. 

You also recognize and accept that we are not responsible for any losses, directly or indirectly, from enforcement of our obligations under applicable laws, rules, regulations or lawful government order. 

We reserve the right to deny, delay, or cancel a transaction that we perceive as a risk of criminal, fraudulent activity, or in violation of these Terms of Service.

## PRICE FLUCTUATIONS
Cryptocurrency and digital assets are highly experimental and risky. Our website and service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without users necessarily being aware of these changes.

While we make our best attempts to execute the translation as quickly as possible, users who are sensitive to the exchange rate they receive may want to exercise caution. We are not responsible for loss of asset value due to volatile exchange rates. 

## REFUND POLICY
Digital assets are generally irreversible due to the immutable nature of the blockchain technology, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transitory. We are not responsible for any risk in use of our website and services, including, without limitation, exchange rate risk and market risk. 

Digital assets sent to the incorrect address (e.g. BTC sent to a BCC address) will not be refunded and for all intents and purposes be considered as lost and out of reach.

All transactions are generally considered final but users can request a refund and we will handle all refund requests on a case by case basis. Any decisions we make with respect to a refund is final. 
Please refer to the contact page on the [website](https://www.sect31.com) for contact information.

## THIRD-PARTY PHISHING SCAMS
We are not responsible for funds that have been sent to any fake phishing scams. It is the responsibility of the user to verify they are visiting the correct domain and to search for the security certificate in the URL bar of their browser.

Users should not trust private messages, solicitations, or requests for funds from people claiming to represent us unless you have verified that it is an official request from an employee or otherwise representative. When in doubt, contact us directly to verify any messaging. 

Please refer to the contact page on the [website](https://www.sect31.com) for contact information.

## INVESTMENT ADVICE
We do not endorse or recommend any particular digital asset, transaction, or purchasing strategy. No content on our website nor communications with company personnel constitutes purchase or investment advice and independent advice should be sought where appropriate. You acknowledge and agree that all purchase decisions are made solely by you and we bear no responsibility or liability for the outcome of your decisions. 

The digital assets available on our platform are not securities and users should not expect profits from the ledger entry translation of any digital asset. Ledger entry translation should be performed with the intent to make use of the underlying utility of the digital asset.

## PRIVACY STATEMENT
Due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, transactions to and from our website and services are public and easily correlated. Law enforcement has full access to the blockchain information that goes in or out of our system. Therefore, utilizing our website or services to conduct illegal activity is pointless.

By accepting our Terms, you expressly allow us to export data outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside or are located when you access our website or services or by consenting via an "opt-in" mechanism. You also expressly allow us to store the sending address of the input assets, the destination address, the refund address, your IP address, and the input and output amounts for each translation. 

If you are accessing our website or services through an affiliate or third party website or service, you expressly allow us to store the website or service name and your username or user identifier that you identify yourself with on that platform as well.

We reserve the right to provide information to law enforcement personnel and other third parties to answer inquiries, participate in investigations, respond to legal process, respond to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court's authority, and to protect ourselves and our users.
